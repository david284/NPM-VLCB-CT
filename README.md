# NPM-VLCB-CT

# Installation:
This application requires NodeJs (& npm) to run
Get NPM from -> https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

On windows, once installed, if you then get npm failing to run (I get mixed '\' and '/' trying to load files),  you may need to "Set the npm run shell" by running the following
	npm config set script-shell "C:\\Program Files\\git\\bin\\bash.exe"
Original source -> https://digipie.github.io/digidocs/nodejs/set-npm-run-shell/

After the repo is cloned locally, at the root of the repo, run 'npm install' to load all dependancies

To prove the installation has worked, run the stand alone tests using 'npm tests'

# Execution:

The app expects to use the cbuServer service installed locally to connect to a CANUSB4 for the can bus connection
See https://www.merg.org.uk/merg_wiki/doku.php?id=cbus_server:cbus_server&s[]=cbusserver

The ip & port settings are in the server.js file, and easily changed for a remote IP connection or a different port

To run the app, use 'npm start'
The program will prompt to put the module under test into setup mode (press it's button),
and will proceed with testing once it receives the intial contact with the module

The test aims to verify some values using a module-descriptor file thats specific to the module & it's firmware version
It's quite likely this module_descriptor file doesn't exist for the module being tested
The program will indicate the filename that it's trying to load for the module under test if it fails 
Copying an exiting file in the module_descriptors folder & modifying the filename & contents to suit is straighforward

# Test cases
The aim is to exercise all combinations of parameters for supported opcodes. Boundary values are used for efficient test cases (see Boundary Value Analysis below).

# Boundary Value Analysis
Boundary Value Analysis (or Boundary testing) is based on testing the boundary values of valid and invalid partitions (closely related to equivalence partitioning). The behavior at the boundary of each partion is more likely to be incorrect than the behavior within the partion, so boundaries are an area where testing is likely to yield defects.
For example, a byte variable with a valid range of 0 to 100 (and, by implication, an invalid range of 101 to 255), would have boundary test values of 0, 100, 101 and 255, where 0 and 100 would have a valid result, and 101 and 255 would have an invalid result (whatever that means in that context). An extra test case worth adding would be a single bit - see single bit test case below

# Single bit test case
Where the test value requires programatic ordering, e.g. where the value is a less than a whole byte, or occupies multiple bytes, then setting just one bit will validate the ordering & placement of the value. Adding a one bit test to every set of test cases ensures this is never neglected, even if it's strictly not required in some cases.
